# Decentralized-Uber

> Decentralized Uber is not everyone broadcasting their location onto a blockchain and getting matched up by algorithmic oracles based on location proximity and bidding on the best price for a ride.
> Decentralized Uber is an unbundled Uber, with the possibility for redundancy in some areas to prevent there from being a central point of control or failure.
